# Firestore Rules Update Required

## Issue
You're experiencing permission errors when updating custom categories because the Firestore security rules need to be updated to properly handle public category permissions.

## Solution
The Firestore rules in this project have been updated to fix the permission issues. You need to deploy these updated rules to your Firebase project.

## Steps to Deploy Updated Rules

### Option 1: Using Firebase Console (Recommended)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (`finbuddy-2025`)
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** > **Rules**
4. Replace the existing rules with the updated rules from the `firestore.rules` file in this project
5. Click **Publish** to deploy the new rules

### Option 2: Using Firebase CLI
If you have Firebase CLI installed locally:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## What Was Fixed
- **Improved permission structure**: Separated create, update, and delete permissions for public categories
- **Enhanced error handling**: Added graceful handling of permission errors in the application code
- **Better user experience**: Users can now update their private categories even if public category sharing is restricted

## Updated Rules
The new Firestore rules ensure that:
- Users can only read/write their own private data
- All authenticated users can read public categories
- Only the original creator can update or delete their public categories
- Permission errors are handled gracefully without breaking the app

## After Deployment
Once you deploy the updated rules:
- Custom category updates should work without permission errors
- Public category sharing will work properly
- Error messages will be more user-friendly
- The console errors should be eliminated
