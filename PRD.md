## Design Direction

The design should feel professional yet approachable - like a modern banking app that prioritizes clarity over flashiness, with clean lines and purposeful use of color to communicate financial status at a glance.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using green/red opposition to communicate financial health, with blue as a calming primary that conveys trust and stability.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Conveys trust, stability, and financial professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft Gray (oklch(0.95 0.01 240)) for backgrounds, Medium Gray (oklch(0.7 0.02 240)) for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Green (oklch(0.65 0.2 140)) - Success states, positive budget status, income indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 10.4:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Green oklch(0.65 0.2 140)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Light Gray oklch(0.95 0.01 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and clarity - using a clean sans-serif that feels both modern and trustworthy, similar to financial institutions but more approachable.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (General Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Labels/Meta): Inter Medium/14px/tight line height
  - Numbers (Amounts): Inter SemiBold/16px/tabular spacing for alignment

## Animations

Subtle and purposeful animations that guide attention to important changes like budget updates or successful actions, with smooth transitions that feel responsive rather than decorative.
